# OC | Build web apps with ReactJS
This repo contains some dumb code that I wrote during `Build web apps with ReactJS` course, part of the `Front-end Developer Path` at [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/61-front-end-developer)

## Projects
I consider them more of exercises than projects due to their simplicity, but yeah - let's call them projects for now:

### 01: Ticking Clock
A Live Digital Clock using `React Event Lifecycle`!

### 02: Background Changer
A Simple button that changes its parent `background` when triggered, it also changes its text according to the new background

### 03: Store
This is the most complex one, it's a store with a static data objects, it has some features: `Search Filters`, `Sort Options`, `Add Product Form`, `Delete Product Button`

## Getting Started
Every project has its own branch:

- P1: `01-ticking-clock`
- P2: `02-background-changer`
- P3: `03-store`

We will start by getting the project to our local machine:

- `git clone https://github.com/elharony/OC-Build-web-apps-with-ReactJS.git`

After that, we need to switch to a specific project:

- `git checkout {branchName}`

Then, RUN our APP!

- `yarn start`

> Feel free to use `npm` instead!
